The **GitHub Repository Analyzer** is a Java console application that analyzes a GitHub userâ€™s public repositories. Users input a username, and the app fetches data via the GitHub API, displaying stats like total repositories, stars, and average stars, plus a breakdown of programming languages (e.g., "Java: 60%, HTML: 40%"). It offers CSV export for data storage and a JavaFX window showcasing a bar chart of stars per repository alongside a pie chart of language distribution. Built with Maven, OkHttp, Jackson, and JavaFX, it blends data retrieval, processing, and visualization for an engaging user experience.
